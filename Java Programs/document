Java & OOP Concepts

1) .class & .java files
2) Static Method -> java main method is always static 
3) What is Maven ?
4)public class & class (public class name same as per file name)
5) static variable memory allocation is one time and it will share among all the instance of the class.
6) Objects, Anonymous Object , class , constructor 
7) Static keyword, apply on variable , method , constructor, block, Nested class
8) Why is the Java main method static?
   Ans) It is because the object is not required to call a static method. If it were a non-static method, JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.
9) Static block
10) Inheritance -> Single, multilevel, hierarchical , multiple and hybrid
11) Polymorphism -> method overloading & method overriding
12) super keyword, final keyword, runtime Polymorphism, 
13) Instance initializer block
14) dynamic binding 
15) instance of operator
16)Abstract class





Description why we put public and static before the main method 

Main method indicates start of the execution point. So this method has to be accessible to outside world in order to execute that class.

So you have to define main class public as it will allow user to access the class from outside.

Now static,

Static indiactes that the main method is not instance of any class but a global method. Now you need to understand what is a global methodâ€¦.

A global method is something that has a single instance and do not belong to any particular class. A static method can be called without object i.e. , you need not to write object.main().

Now main method is defined as static so that you can call it without any object. So you needn't to declare any object to call a class.
